Summary of the Solution
Problem-Solving: I implemented the solutions using an ASP.NET Core API to handle each of the problem-solving tasks.
SQL Database: I created the necessary tables as specified in the assignment. You can find the SQL file, Exams_Consultic.sql, in the repository. This file includes the database and table creation scripts for Purchase Order Header, Purchase Order Lines, Currency, and Vendors.
